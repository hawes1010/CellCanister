~ Steps for using Cell can properly

1. Pick which cell canister you want to text, 2 for now
2. Text that number a "?" to get the list of commands.  Note: if this is the 
first time the device is being texted, it will send the commands anyway as a courtesy
3. Use one of the commands desired: most likely Pull Sample 1. 
For reference:  structure below is: "Command": Response.  The phrase on the left side of the colon is the command you send.
         "?": "Sending Commands",
        "Check Can".lower(): "Checking on Can",
        "Pull Sample 1".lower(): "Pulling Sample from pump 1",
      // There is a Pull Sample 2 command. this command is for future use.  Ineffective at the moment.
        "Reset".lower(): "Resetting Pump system",
        "Time Sample".lower(): "How many seconds do you want the pump open?"//Note this one is still relatively untested
Command Functions:
   '?' gives you a list above of items on the left
   'Pull Sample 1' pulls from the 1st pump (This opens the solenoid for 30 seconds)
   'Pull Sample 2' pulls from the 2nd pump (This assumed 2 seperate pumps)// note this is ineffective
   'Reset' resets software on cell can
   'Time Sample' will wait for you to send how many seconds the pump stays open. //needs more testing
   ~~~More functions can be added or altered easily~~~         
4. If you need to reset the device, there is a hardware switch, as well as a software reset command you can text to the device.
