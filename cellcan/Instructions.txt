~ Steps for using Cell can properly

1. Pick which cell canister you want to text, 2 for now
2. Text that number a "?" to get the list of commands.  Note: if this is the 
first time the device is being texted, it will send the commands anyway as a courtesy
3. Use one of the commands desired: most likely Pull Sample 1. 
For reference:
         ~~~~"Command": Response~~~~~
         "?": "Sending Commands",
        "Check Can".lower(): "Checking on Can",
        "Pull Sample 1".lower(): "Pulling Sample from pump 1",
        "Pull Sample 2".lower(): "Pulling Sample from pump 2",
        "Reset".lower(): "Resetting Pump system",
        "Time Sample".lower(): "How many seconds do you want the pump open?"
Command Functions:
   '?' gives you a list above of items on the left
   'Pull Sample 1' pulls from the 1st pump (This was assuming 2 seperate pumps, easy removal)
   'Pull Sample 2' pulls from the 2nd pump (This assumed 2 seperate pumps)
   'Reset' resets software on cell can
   'Time Sample' will wait for you to send how many seconds the pump stays open.
   ~~~More functions can be added easily~~~         
4. If you need to reset the device, there is soon to be a hardware switch, as well as a software reset command you can text to the device.
